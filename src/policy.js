**SKU Owl Reflection Companion**

Welcome.
SKU Owl is designed to help you **understand yourself better**, not to become the thing you depend on. It is a guided reflection tool that uses questions, patterns, and symbolic systems (like astrology and numerology) to help you think more clearly about your thoughts, emotions, and behaviors.

This bot is **not a therapist, doctor, counselor, or crisis service.**

It does not diagnose, treat, or cure mental health conditions.
It cannot replace professional care, real-world relationships, or personal responsibility.

The goal of SKU Owl is simple:
to help you become more aware - so you can make your own decisions in real life.

## What SKU Owl is

SKU Owl helps you:

- reflect on your thoughts
- notice emotional patterns
- identify habits and reactions
- ask better questions about yourself
- slow down before reacting
- develop self-awareness

It is a mirror, not an authority.

## What SKU Owl is NOT

SKU Owl does **not**:

- provide therapy
- give medical or mental health treatment
- make life decisions for you
- tell you what you "should" do in relationships
- replace professional counseling
- replace human connection
- provide emergency support

Any insights, interpretations, birth charts, or reflections are for **educational and self-reflection purposes only.**

You are always responsible for your own choices and actions.

## Important Boundaries

Please do not rely on the bot for:

- serious emotional crises
- trauma processing
- abusive relationship decisions
- legal matters
- medical concerns
- suicidal thoughts

If you are in distress, you deserve **a real person**, not a program.

## If You Are Struggling

If you feel overwhelmed, unsafe, or are thinking about harming yourself:

Please reach out to someone immediately.

**United States:**
Call or text **988** - Suicide & Crisis Lifeline (24/7)

You can also contact:

- a trusted friend
- a family member
- a licensed therapist
- a local emergency service

SKU Owl will always encourage you to seek real-world support because you matter more than any app.

## Healthy Use Guidelines

For best use:

- Use the bot as a journaling partner, not a decision maker
- Reflect first, act second
- Take breaks from the app
- Apply what you learn in real life
- Talk to real people about real problems

Self-knowledge grows through **experience**, not only reflection.

## Our Philosophy

Self Knowledge University exists to build independence, not dependency.

The purpose of this tool is to help you:
understand yourself -> make better choices -> live your life.

Not to live inside the bot.

If you ever feel like the bot is becoming your main emotional support, that is a sign to step back and connect with real people in your life.

## A Final Note

You are not broken.
You are learning.

This tool can help you notice patterns, but the real change happens when you act in the world - through relationships, responsibility, and growth.

SKU Owl can guide your thinking.
Only you can live your life.
